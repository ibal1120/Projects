# My Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! I'm actively transitioning into the world of tech, and this space is where I bring everything I’m learning to life.

## About Me

I come from a different career background, but my passion for solving problems, learning new tools, and building things that actually help people brought me here.

Through my academic journey and personal study, I’ve been diving deep into:
-  Python programming
-  Web app development (like Streamlit)
-  Logical problem-solving
-  Experimentation through real-world mini-projects

I created this repo to **document and showcase my growth** — each project here reflects a new concept learned, a challenge tackled, or an idea brought to life.

## What You’ll Find Here

- ** Tuition Calculator**  
  A clean, Streamlit-powered app to forecast college tuition over time with styling inspired by College of Southern Nevada (CSN).

- ** Day of the Week Finder**  
  A simple app using Zeller’s Congruence to determine the weekday of any given date.

- *(More projects coming soon — I’m just getting started!)*

## Why This Portfolio Matters

Switching careers isn’t easy — but it’s been rewarding. Every project I take on teaches me something new and reminds me why I made this leap: to build, to grow, and to contribute.

Whether it's a small utility, a bigger app, or a future team collaboration, I’m eager to:
- Put what I’ve learned into action
- Continue building projects with real-world relevance
- Show that I’m ready to keep learning, working, and leveling up
